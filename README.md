# PVPred: Peptide-based Vaccine Predictor (Version 1.0)
PVPred (v1.0) is an immuno-informatics pipeline for predicting peptide-based vaccine candidates. It was developed and deployed for the prediction of peptide-based vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 in the research article:        .  A summary flowchart (workflow)of PVPred (v1.0) is presented in Figure 1 of the above mentioned research article. Each step of the pipeline is described in detail in the Supplementary File 1 of the above mentioned research article with all the tools, software, servers, databases, references and specific parameters used.
