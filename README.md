# PVPredPip: Peptide-based Vaccine Prediction Pipeline (Version 1.0)
PVPredPip (v1.0) is an immuno-informatics pipeline for predicting peptide-based vaccine candidates. It was developed and deployed for the prediction of peptide-based vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 in the research article: (https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bib/bbab496/6484513).  A summary flowchart (workflow)of PVPredPip (v1.0) is presented in Figure 1 of the above mentioned research article. Each step of the pipeline is described in detail in the Supplementary File 1 of the above mentioned research article with all the tools, software, servers, databases, references and specific parameters used. All the in-house scripts used in this pipeline are present in the following public repository: https://github.com/ShuklaLab/PVPredPip/tree/main/Scripts
