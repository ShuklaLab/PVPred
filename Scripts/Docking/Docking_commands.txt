## Molecular Docking
#
# All the input files required for performing docking is provided in the folder Docking_input_files
#
# Users are encouraged to follow the tutorials available at http://ringo.ams.stonybrook.edu/index.php/Rizzo_Lab_Information_and_Tutorials#DOCK
# for detailed description of all the steps and description of all the parameters.

1. Preparation of the ligand and receptor

# Preparation of receptor file
          - Open the complex PDB file in Chimera
          - Isolate the receptor using Chimera's select and delete tool by deleting the ligand, water molecules and ions, if any.
          - Next, delete all the hydrogen atoms and save the receptor as a mol2 file. (receptor.noH.mol2)

- Open the receptor file (receptor.noH.mol2) in Chimera
          - Add Hydrogens using Tools -> Structure Editing -> addH 
          - Add Charge using Tools -> Structure Editing -> Add Charge
          - Save as a mol2 file. (receptor.withH.mol2)

- The above steps can also be accomplished by
          Tools -> Structure/Binding Analysis -> DockPrep

# Preparation of ligand file
- Open the complex PDB file using Chimera.
- Isolate the ligand by deleting the receptor and other molecules and follow the steps as followed for the preparation of receptor file, i.e.,
          - Add Hydrogen atoms
          - Add charge
          - Save as mol2 fie. (ligand.withH.mol2)


2. Generation of receptor surface and spheres

# Preparation of DMS file

- Open the receptor file (receptor.noH.mol2) using chimera and follow the steps below
          - Action -> Surface -> Show
          - Tools -> Structure Editing -> Write DMS
          - Save the dms file as receptor.noH.dms

- Open the receptor.noH.dms file in chimera to make sure that the dms file is correctly generated.

# Generation of spheres
          - Generate the spheres by executing the following command.
 
 sphgen -i INSPH -o OUTSPH

  where, INSPH is the input file containing all the parameters for generation of spheres.

The above command will generate a sphere file (receptor.sph).

# Selecting Spheres for definition of the binding pocket 

sphere_selector receptor.sph ligand.withH.mol2 10.0

Execution of above command will select all the spheres within 10 Angstrom of the ligand

3. Generation of box and grid

# Generation of Box
- Execute the following command for generating the box. The input file showbox.in contains all the necessary parameters and will generate a box file after execution. (receptor.box.pdb)

showbox < showbox.in

# Generation of Grid

grid -i grid.in -o gridinfo.out

The file grid.in contains all the parameters and successful execution of the above command will generate three files: gridinfo.out, grid.nrg, grid.bmp.


4. Rigid & fexible docking
- Rigid or flexible docking can be performed by executing the following command

 dock6 -i min.in
 dock6 -i flex.in
